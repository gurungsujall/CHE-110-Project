                <h3>1. Global Overview:</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the Global Overview section of WaterWatch Global. In this section, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the state of global water availability, emphasizing variations across continents and countries.</p>
                <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                <p>Water is a fundamental component of our world, covering about 71% of the Earth's surface. However, the distribution of water resources is far from uniform. Oceans, the largest reservoirs of water, contain about 97% of the Earth's water, but this vast amount is saline and unsuitable for human consumption or most agricultural purposes.</p>
                <p>Freshwater, the lifeblood of ecosystems and human societies, constitutes only around 2.5% of the total water on Earth. The majority of this freshwater is locked in glaciers and ice caps, leaving a relatively small percentage available in rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers.</p>
                <p>Understanding the global distribution of freshwater is crucial for managing water resources sustainably. The challenges we face in ensuring water security are diverse, ranging from population growth and increasing demand for agriculture to the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns and water availability.</p>
